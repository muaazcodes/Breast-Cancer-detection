# Breast Cancer Data Analysis Project

## What I Did in This Project

In this project, I analyzed a breast cancer dataset to explore patterns and differences between benign and malignant tumors. My main steps included:

* Examining the dataset to understand its structure and features.
* Performing data cleaning, filtering, and sorting to focus on relevant cases.
* Using **NumPy** for numerical computations.
* Using **Pandas** for data grouping, aggregation, and manipulation to summarize important statistics.
* Creating multiple visualizations with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** such as bar charts, scatter plots, and histograms to reveal trends and relationships.
* Studying the relationship between tumor radius and area to see how they vary between benign and malignant cases.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* **NumPy** – for numerical operations and calculations.
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation, grouping, and aggregation.
* **Matplotlib** – for plotting graphs and visualizations.
* **Seaborn** – for advanced and visually appealing statistical plots.

## Key Findings

* Malignant tumors generally have larger radius and area compared to benign tumors.
* Scatter plots showed clear clusters separating benign and malignant tumors based on size measurements.

## Conclusion

This project helped me improve my skills in **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data analysis and visualization, as well as learn how to interpret medical data to identify meaningful patterns.
